## Features
- Discord Token Stealing (only java stealer that has this)
- Browser password stealing
- Browser cookie stealing
- .ROBLOSECURITY stealing (roblox accounts)
- System Info

## Directions
Simply change your webhook URL in the `Configuration` class, then build and send it to whomever you please.

You can also, obviously, implement this into any Java application (like a Minecraft mod or client).

## Suggestions/Bug reports/Feature requests
Simply open an issue and I'll attend to it as soon as I can.

Feel free to make a pull request to add features.

## Credits
The base of this RAT was largely inspired by the Yoink rat, which I do not have a link to. I also directly stole some of yoink's code in the `PayloadDelivery` class.
